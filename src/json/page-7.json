  "desc": "Nouns are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other networks such as IPFS. This is possible because noun parts are compressed and stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of lossless compression.The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base encoded."
