  "desc": "Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of Compound Governance and is the main governing body of the Nouns ecosystem. The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily noun auctions. Each noun is an irrevocable member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your noun."
